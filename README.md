# hello-world
Blah! Kicking the tires...
I am a recent grad of the MITxl Big Data and Social Analytics Certificate program. 
As a graduation present, I am setting up this GitHub environment to collaborate 
on a couple of small solo maiden voyage visualization projects. If you have some time
and the know how, I hope you can help me learn and in turn, I will give back as well!
Cheers, ADF
